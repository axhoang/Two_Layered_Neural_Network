# Two-Layered Neural Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

Welcome to the Two-Layered Neural Network project! This repository is dedicated to developing a machine learning model capable of recognizing handwritten digits. Our approach uses a simple but effective neural network architecture designed to provide foundational insights into the mechanics of machine learning and neural computation.

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to construct and train a neural network to accurately identify handwritten digits from the widely-used MNIST dataset. This task is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and serves as an excellent benchmark for neural network performance.

## Why This Project?

Recognizing handwritten digits is not just an academic exerciseâ€”it has practical applications in areas like postal mail sorting and bank check processing. By building this neural network, we aim to demonstrate the core principles of neural networks, including how they learn and make predictions.

## Features of the Project

- **Neural Network Design**: A concise two-layer neural network with a clear focus on foundational learning principles.
- **Data Handling**: Comprehensive scripts for loading, processing, and normalizing data to ensure optimal conditions for model training.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilize matplotlib to visualize training data and predictions, helping to understand model performance visually.
